# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Network Intrusion Detection System is a software tool to detect network intrusion using various machine learning algorithms in Network Security. 
A reasonably good network intrusion detection system generally requires a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate in order to predict anomalies more accurately. Older datasets cannot capture the schema of a set of modern attacks; therefore, modelling based on these datasets lacked sufficient generalizability. The proposed paper operates on the UNSW-NB15 Dataset, which is currently one of the best   representatives of modern attacks. Network Intrusion Detection System is a software tool to detect network intrusion using various machine learning algorithms in Network Security. IDS monitors a network for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insider. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model(classifier) capable of distinguishing between ‘bad connections’ (intrusion/attacks) and a good (normal) connections.
The proposed system is a comparative study on machine learning algorithms for Network Intrusion Detection
